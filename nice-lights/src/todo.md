# Ice
- Lights in ice
- Program lights using code
- Mount camera above, pointing down. Read non-background blobs from camera.
- Use position from blobs to light up the ice.
- Gamification
  - Light up targets on ice, point is scored when blob is positioned over target.
  - Flash on ice (or rapid outgoing glow around target) when target is hit.
  - Place a physical (or virtual(just a colored dot)) on the ice. If the puck/ball hits it it blows up.
